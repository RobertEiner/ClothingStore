This project was made during the course DIT-043 Object Oriented Programming in the Software Engineering and Management bachelors program from Gothenburg University.

It is a terminal based system made purely in Java, using OOP concepts such as abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance. 
Note that the testing part of the program was provided, it was not created by me.
